🌐 Software Developer Portfolio

🧑‍💻 Welcome to my Portfolio! 💻

This site was designed with HTML5, CSS3, and a bit of JavaScript to add interactive elements. It's an evolution of my first portfolio, which I created in 2021 during my initial year in a Web/Software Development course.

Since then, I've expanded my skills and knowledge significantly. This latest version of my portfolio highlights the following:

    🆕 A fresh layout that reflects my growth as a developer.
    🛠️ Updated skillset showcasing my current tech stack and projects experience.
    🚀 Optimizations for responsive design, accessibility, and performance.

Feel free to explore, connect, and check out the code!
