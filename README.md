🌐 Software Developer Portfolio

🧑‍💻 Welcome to my Portfolio! 💻

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with **HTML5, CSS3, and a small amount of JavaScript**.

The portfolio was originally created in **2021** and has been **iteratively improved** as I progressed through my BSc (Hons) in Software Development.

### What this portfolio showcases
- Selected **academic and personal projects**, including full-stack and data-focused work
- A clear overview of my **technical skills** at this stage
- A simple, responsive layout focused on clarity and usability

The portfolio is intended to demonstrate a **quick overview of my work and progression** as I prepare for **Graduate / Junior Software Developer roles starting in 2026**.

Feel free to explore the site and review the code.
